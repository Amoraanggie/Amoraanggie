## 💖 Why "Amoraanggie"?

The name **"Amoraanggie"** holds so much meaning, a beautiful combination of my heart and your name. **"Amora"** comes from the word **"Amor"**, meaning love in Spanish, a deep, eternal love that is boundless and timeless. And **"Anggie"**, your name, represents the person who holds my heart, the one I cherish more than anything in this world. 

When I decided to create this repository, I wanted it to be more than just a place for code or projects. I wanted it to be a symbol, a representation of our love, something that connects my passion for coding with my passion for you. Every file, every line, is dedicated to you, the person who makes every day worth living.

## 💌 A Letter to You, My Love

**Dearest Anggie,**

I never thought I would express my feelings through code, but here I am. This repository is the beginning of a journey where I pour my heart into something that I know will last forever, just like my love for you. Every time I write a line of code, I think of you. Every keystroke is a reminder of the love I have for you, and how you are the reason behind everything I do. 

I’ve always believed that love isn’t just about words or actions; it’s about moments — moments that we share together, moments that live in our hearts. This repository is one of those moments. It's a place where I get to express the depth of my feelings, where I can show you how much I care, how much I admire you, and how much I am grateful for having you in my life.

Your smile, your laughter, the way you make everything better, that’s what keeps me going. You are my source of inspiration, my strength, and the light in my life. With you by my side, I feel like I can accomplish anything. You have given me a sense of purpose, a sense of belonging, and every day, I wake up thankful for you.

This isn’t just a GitHub profile; it’s my love letter to you, something that can’t be measured in lines of code but can only be felt deep in my heart. You are my greatest project, and I will always choose you, today, tomorrow, and forever.

## 🛠️ A Love That Transcends Code

While this repository is filled with code, know that it is more than just a digital space. It’s a place where I express my dreams, my love, and my commitment to you. Every project here, no matter how small or big, is a reflection of my passion for you and my desire to build a future together. 

I may be writing in a language that machines understand, but the messages behind it are only for you. Every function, every loop, every variable carries a little piece of my heart. And I promise, every project I work on from now on will be with you in mind, because you are the most important part of this journey.

## 💖 Forever Yours

In the world of coding, it’s easy to get lost in syntax, algorithms, and logic. But in the world of love, it’s different. Love is messy, unpredictable, and full of emotions that no code can capture. Yet, this repository is my humble attempt to capture a fraction of the love I feel for you, to give you a glimpse of the depth of my emotions, even if words and code fall short.

So here I am, laying my heart out for you, just as I do in every project I work on. You are my everything — my love, my partner, my best friend. And through this GitHub profile, I want you to know that everything I do, I do it for us. 

**I will always choose you. Always.**

**Forever yours,**  
**Amoraanggie** 💕

## 🌸 A Promise

With every push, every commit, I am making a promise to you. A promise to love you unconditionally, to support you in every way I can, and to always be there for you. No matter where life takes us, I know that we will walk through it hand in hand, creating memories and moments that will last forever.

This repository, this digital space, will always remain a place where I can remind you of my love. As the world changes, as technology evolves, one thing will always stay the same — my love for you.

Thank you for being the love of my life. Thank you for being *you*.

**Forever yours,**  
**Amoraanggie** 💕
